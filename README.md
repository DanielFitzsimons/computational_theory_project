# Countdown Game Solver Notebook

This repository hosts the documentation and Python code for a solver of the "Countdown" numbers game, as featured on the popular television show. The notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the game's structure, challenges, and the computational strategies employed to solve it efficiently.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the "Countdown" game derived from "Des chiffres et des lettres."
   - Description of the numbers game segment.

2. **Game Rules**
   - Explanation of tile selection, gameplay, and scoring.

3. **Theoretical Concepts**
   - Computational problems in the Countdown game.
   - Models of computation: Turing Machines and Finite Automata.
   - Programming paradigms: Imperative, Functional, and Object-Oriented Programming.

4. **Computational Complexity**
   - Analysis of the complexity involved in the game using Big O notation.
   - Discussion of the practical constraints that reduce theoretical complexity.

5. **Solver Algorithm**
   - Detailed description of the recursive backtracking algorithm used to solve the game.
   - Code snippets showing key functions such as `solve_numbers` and `solve_recursive`.

6. **Practical Implementation**
