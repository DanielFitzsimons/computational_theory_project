    "### What is Countdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Countdown* originated from the French game show \"Des chiffres et des lettres\" (Of Numbers and Letters). The game challenges two players to compete in verbal and mathematical skills by forming the longest word possible from a random selection of letters, or achieving a target number using a set of numbers and basic arithmetic operations.[1] \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is structured with clear rules to facilitate competition:[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tile Selection**:\n",
    "   - Six face-down numbered tiles are chosen from 24 shuffled tiles.\n",
    "   - Tiles are divided into two categories: Large Numbers and Small Numbers.\n",
    "     - Large Numbers include {25, 50, 75, 100}.\n",
    "     - Small Numbers include two of each from 1 to 10.\n",
    "   - Contestants select unseen tiles from the Large set (up to 4) and the rest from the Small set to total six numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gameplay**:\n",
    "   - A three-digit target number is randomly generated by a computer.\n",
    "   - Contestants have 30 seconds to approximate the target number using the four basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "   - Tiles can be used only once, and concatenation of numbers is not allowed.\n",
    "   - No calculations may result in negative numbers or fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scoring**:\n",
    "   - Exact solution: 10 points.\n",
    "   - Within five of the target: 7 points.\n",
    "   - Within ten of the target: 5 points.\n"

    "## Understanding Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity refers to the amount of computational resources required by an algorithm to solve a problem, typically measured in terms of time (how long it takes to solve) and space (the amount of memory it uses). This concept helps in understanding the efficiency of algorithms and can guide the selection of the most appropriate one based on the constraints of the problem. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance to Countdown\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Countdown game, understanding computational complexity is crucial for both contestants and algorithm designers. For contestants, it helps in choosing the quickest strategy to arrive at the target number under time constraints. For developers, it aids in crafting algorithms that efficiently simulate the game or assist players, ensuring that the solutions are generated within the brief play period of each round. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity of the Numbers Game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown numbers game can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), where the goal is to reach a specific target number by using any combination of six chosen numbers and the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The constraints are that each number can be used at most once, and operations such as division must result in integer outcomes. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenges in solving this problem algorithmically include: [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrity of Operations**: The requirement for division to yield whole numbers and for all operations to avoid negative outcomes or fractions constrains the use of straightforward arithmetic solutions.\n",
    "- **Limited Use of Numbers**: Each number can only be used once, which restricts the number of possible operations and sequences.\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Finding the most efficient way to reach the exact number or get as close as possible within a very short timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where the target number is 653, and the available numbers are {25, 50, 75, 100, 3, 8}. The solution might involve a series of calculations such as \\(75 \\times 8 = 600\\), followed by \\(50 + 3 = 53\\), summing these to reach exactly 653. This example demonstrates the expanding search space as more numbers and operations are considered, and how choosing the right operations in the right order is key to solving the problem efficiently.\n",
